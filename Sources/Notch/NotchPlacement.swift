/// Everything else works in **stack space**, which has only two coordinates and
/// no opinion about the screen:
///
/// - `along` runs the length of the provider stack, from its start to its end.
/// - `across` measures **inward from the bezel**, so zero is always the screen
///   edge and a positive value always moves toward the middle of the screen.
///
/// That is what lets `NotchLayout` stay the one-dimensional set of constants it
/// already was: its maths never cared which axis it was on, only that it had
/// one. This type turns a stack-space coordinate into a point in the panel,
/// whose origin is top-left (`NSHostingView` is flipped, and so is SwiftUI's
/// `GeometryReader`, so the two agree).
