/// Reports whether Codex is mid-turn.
///
/// Codex publishes no status field — no equivalent of Claude Code's `status` or
/// Cursor's `unfinishedRunAt`. What it does do is append to a thread's rollout
/// log continuously while a turn runs, so a rollout written moments ago means
/// work is happening now.
///
/// **That is a heuristic, and it is labelled as one.** It cannot tell a turn
/// that is thinking from one that finished a second ago, so it errs short: the
/// ring stops spinning `staleAfter` seconds after the last write rather than
/// claiming activity it cannot see. If Codex grows a real status field this
/// should be replaced by it.
